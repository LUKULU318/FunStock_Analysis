# Stock Analysis and Revenue Data Visualization Project

## Overview
This project is part of the Coursera **Python for Data Science, AI, and Development** course. The project demonstrates stock data extraction, web scraping, and visualization of stock prices and quarterly revenue for **Tesla**, **Amazon**, **AMD**, and **GameStop**.

As a Data Scientist/Analyst, the goal of this project is to extract historical stock data and revenue reports using Python libraries, web scraping techniques, and visualization tools like Plotly to create an interactive dashboard that identifies trends and patterns.

## Project Structure
- **Data Extraction**: Used the `yfinance` library to extract stock price data.
- **Web Scraping**: Utilized `BeautifulSoup` to scrape revenue data from a webpage.
- **Data Visualization**: Leveraged `Plotly` to create subplots showing both stock prices and revenue over time.

## Key Libraries Used
- `yfinance`: For fetching stock data.
- `pandas`: For data manipulation.
- `BeautifulSoup`: For web scraping financial data.
- `plotly`: For visualizing stock prices and revenue data in a dashboard format.
  
## Features
- Extracts **Tesla**, **Amazon**, **AMD**, and **GameStop** historical stock prices.
- Scrapes quarterly revenue data for **Tesla** and **GameStop**.
- Plots both stock price and revenue in an interactive Plotly dashboard.
